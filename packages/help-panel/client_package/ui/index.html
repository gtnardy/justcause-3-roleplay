                                In Just Cause - Roleplay, you can carry out Jobs alongside players from around the world. As you play you will gain Experience (XP). Jobs have tasks that provide extra XP. As your XP increases, your Level goes Up. This will unlock new Jobs, equipment and abilities. Cash is another key to success in Just Cause - Roleplay: buy Houses, Licenses for Driving, Utensils and entertain yourself and others with various activities.

                                New players with low level are benefited with bonus experience and are dispensed with some mechanics until they become accustomed to the game.

                                Leveling Up and Earning Money is the basic of any action on the server! By doing Jobs, you earn money and experience. The money you get by doing jobs will be given to your pocket, so don't forget to deposit it into the Bank. The experience will fill the bar at the top right side of your screen. When it's completely filled, you will level up, unlocking new Jobs and things to do. Aside from doing jobs, you will get extra experience every twenty minutes, and your salary every hour (deposited automatically into your bank account).

                                Driving vehicles spends fuel. You can find your fuel bar at the bottom right side of your screen. Keep in mind that it is only visible in cars. If you need to refuel, just visit a Gas Station and choose on how much you want to fuel. The fuel you have, is for all vehicles. If you run out of fuel completely, you can not enter any vehicle anymore (until you refuel again), so always watch the fuel bar and fuel in time!

                                Not any vehicle has it´s own fuel tank. So if you run out of fuel, another player can still use the vehicle.

If you are being wanted, and a police officer approach and inspect you, he will see all your crimes. If the quantity of Stars is greater than or equal to 2, he can handcuff you and take you to the Police Department, then arrest you.

                                Other way to get rid of the Wanted Stars is to pay for them, you can do that at the Police Department. At the Police Department, besides being able to pay for your Stars, you can buy Weapon Carry Permit and you can see all your crimes that you committed in detail, and their respective values.

When you are arrested, in addition to being stuck for a while, you will also pay the full value for each star, automatically.

                                Races are a type of game mode available in Just Cause - Roleplay. You can play alone or with up dozens of players. Races give you rewards such as Money and XP. For now there is only Land Races, which are divided into two different types (more types cooming soon): Circuit and Point to Point. Circuit races involve repeated timed laps around a set course and Point to Point races run from a start point to a separate finish point.

In addition to this, player can buy their own Personal Car or Bike at <span class="help-panel-link" data-id="23">Dealership</span> that they can locate, lock, and respawn for $150 at their house after it gets destroyed.

							<p>
								Stealing a vehicle from another person who is driving at that moment is considered a crime, giving one wanted star to the thief. Players above level 9 need a license to drive cars and bikes, or it will be considered a crime. To enter a plane, helicopter or boat as driver, you need a license as well.

								Players that own a house are allowed to buy personal vehicles.
							</p>
								
							<p>
								When a vehicle is bought, is spawns at the parking lot at the shop and you can take it with you. In the interaction menu (M) you can find a personal vehicle menu. Here you can locate your vehicle - which sets a marker on it - and lock/ unlock it. You don't have to be in the vehicle to do this. A locked vehicle can't be entered from the driver side by other players. Your vehicle also has a plate (name) that is shown like a players nametag on the vehicle.
							</p>
								
							<p>
								The moment you join the server, your personal vehicle spawns at its last position. It is also possible to spawn your car at your house in the menu of your house. If your vehicle is destroyed, you have to use this menu to trigger your car's insurance and spawn it back at your house for $150. When you spawn a personal vehicle at your house, your old vehicle will be parked in the garage.
							</p>
								
							<p>
								Like any car, you can mod your cars at a <span class="help-panel-link" data-id="13">Pay'n Spray</span> or let a mechanic do it. Only at a pay'n spray you can edit the vehicles plate. Modifications (paint, nitro, turbo jump, plate) will be permanent, even after your vehicle is destroyed and you have to trigger the insurance, or when you join the server later. You can always change the plate and colour again.
							</p>
								
							<p>
								When you buy a house you get the first garage slot for free. For $15.000 you can buy a second slot, and each new slot is $15.000 more expensive than the last one. Normal players can buy up to 10 garage slots, and <span class="help-panel-link vip" data-id="9">VIP</span> players can buy up to 20.

							<p>
								There are three <span class="help-panel-link" data-id="23">Dealerships</span>. Two for cars and one for bikes and quad bikes. To sell a personal vehicle, bring it to a pay'n spray.
